BeagleBone Black Setup Steps
--------------
**NOTE: Removing power by unplugging the power cable can damage the board. Use the power button or terminal interface to power down the board.**

Steps to setup:

1.	If you’re starting with a brand new BeagleBone Black: follow the steps on http://beagleboard.org/getting-started to get started. 
 - **Note:** If you’re using a Mac, you can download and use Pi Filler from http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/ instead of using 7-Zip

2.	The Physical Setup.
 - Connect USB Hub to BeagleBone Black 
 - Connect Mouse and Keyboard to Hub
 - Connect monitor to BeagleBone Black via micro HDMI cable
 - Do not connect to power yet

3.	Setup breadboard and wiring to BeagleBone
 - Insert the Lepton into the breakout board with the black triangle on the faceplate being on bottom right corner. 
 - Attach breakout board to the breadboard.
 - Go to the following link to see the pinout of the BeagleBone that will be configured after the completion of step 7.
   - http://elinux.org/images/b/bf/2_SPI_Ports.PNG
 - Wire the breadboard to the BeagleBone with the following connections:
   - CS to pin 20
    - MISO to pin 21
    - CLK to pin 22
    - GND to pin 1
    - VIN to pin 3


4.	Connect 5V Power Cable to BeagleBone. 
 - **Note:** The board can be powered either by connecting the power cable or connecting to a computer via the USB cable. Connecting both can cause damage to the board. For this section of the setup, we are not connecting to a computer so only the power cable should be attached to the board and not the USB cable.

5.	Update BeagleBone Black’s packages by running the following commands
 - apt-get upgrade
 - apt-get update
 - apt-get install qt4-dev-tools

6.	Reboot BeagleBone Black 

7.	Configure BeagleBone Pins
 - Run the following command to check the board’s slots. There should be 5
   - cat /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots
 - Export SPI device tree overlay with the following command:
   - echo ADAFRUIT-SPI0 > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots
 - When running the cat command from part a, you should now see a 6th slot being occupied 

8.	Clone BeagleBone Black Lepton repository
 - git clone this repo to your machine

9. Run the demo by entering the following commands exactly as they appear
 - cd into the LeptonModule directory
 - cd into bbb_video
 - cd into leptonSDKEmb32PUB
 - make
 - cd ..
 - qmake && make
 - ./bbb
 - **NOTE:** If you’d like to perform I2C functionality, you’ll need to restart your device, configure the device tree overlay and export as outlined in step 7. 
 - Your demo should be running and a video feed should be appearing on your monitor!

10.	Troubleshooting
 - If the demo won't run, remove the power and ground wires and reconnect it to test again.
   - **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Remember to remove power first and then ground to power off. Reattach ground first and then power to power on.
